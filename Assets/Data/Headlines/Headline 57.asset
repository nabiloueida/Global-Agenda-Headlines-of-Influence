  HeadLineTextFormat: '{0} Announces Plan to Replace Workforce with Robots, Says
    They''re ''Easier to Manage and Don''t Need Coffee Breaks, Allied countries express
    concerns.'
  ConsequenceTextFormat: While the enemy countries welcomed the introduction of robotic
    labor as a modern and efficient solution to the workforce problem, allied countries
    saw it as a betrayal to the working class and a threat to their own economic
    stability. The neutral countries largely decided to remain silent on this revelation.
