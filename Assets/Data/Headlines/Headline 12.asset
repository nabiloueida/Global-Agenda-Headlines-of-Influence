  HeadLineTextFormat: '{0} Outlaws Sleep, Causes International Insomnia and Hallucinations

'
  ConsequenceTextFormat: 'The outlawing of sleep implemented by {0} elicited a variety
    of responses from other countries. While some appreciated the opportunity to
    be more productive and active, others expressed concern about the potential for
    negative health consequences and increased hallucinations. Despite the mixed
    reaction, the law ultimately led to mass insomnia and a surge in sleepless nights.
    Neutral countries seem to be taking advantage of this as they are gaining more
    products from this sanction. '
