  ConsequenceTextFormat: "{0} ban on social media platforms was met with a mix of
    outrage and support from the international community. While some applauded it
    as a necessary measure to combat disinformation and protect national security,
    others condemned it as a blatant violation of freedom of expression and human
    rights. Regardless of the debate, the resulting increase in censorship and the
    decrease in freedom of expression were widely acknowledged. \r"
