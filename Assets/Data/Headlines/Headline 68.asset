  HeadLineTextFormat: '{0} Launches new satellite to spy on allied countries. Their
    official statement was that they wanted to monitor and protect their fellow nations.
    But images show that the satellites were monitoring the intimate and scandalous
    lives of allied government officials.'
  ConsequenceTextFormat: "{0}\u2019s launch of the new military grade satellite to
    reportedly keep their allies safe but reports suggest that this was used to spy
    on the intimate lives of government officials to gain leverage over them. This
    has led to dire consequences with their allies as they view this as a breach
    of trust while neutral nations are yet to give an official statement regarding
    this.\r"
