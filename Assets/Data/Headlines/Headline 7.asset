'
  ConsequenceTextFormat: The outlawing of sleep implemented by {0} elicited a variety
    of responses from other countries. While some appreciated the opportunity to
    be more productive and active, others expressed concern about the potential for
    negative health consequences and increased hallucinations. Despite the mixed
    reaction, the law ultimately led to international insomnia and a surge in sleepless
    nights around the world.
