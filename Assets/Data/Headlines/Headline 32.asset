    world\" caused a stir among foodies and travelers alike. Due to the country\u2019s
    lack of fresh produce. While some took it as a challenge to try the dishes for
    themselves, many were dissuaded from visiting the country altogether. The country's
    government responded with a PR campaign to improve the quality of their food,
    but the damage had already been done.\r"
