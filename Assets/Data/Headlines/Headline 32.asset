  HeadLineTextFormat: '{0}''s cuisine Declared "Worst Food in the World," due to
    lack of fresh produce, always relying on foreign imports. Results in Decreased
    Tourism, Increased Indigestion and increased food imports from countries willing

  ConsequenceTextFormat: "The declaration of {0} cuisine as the \"worst food in the
    world\" caused a stir among foodies and travelers alike. Due to the country\u2019s
    lack of fresh produce. While some took it as a challenge to try the dishes for
    themselves, many were dissuaded from visiting the country altogether. The country's
    government responded with a PR campaign to improve the quality of their food,
    but the damage had already been done.\r"
