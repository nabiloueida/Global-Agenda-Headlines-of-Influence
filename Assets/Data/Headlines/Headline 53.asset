    Sparks Global Outrage\r"
  ConsequenceTextFormat: "{0}'s unilateral decision to exit an important international
    treaty has sparked global outrage, with allies expressing disappointment and
    enemies not really reacting to this debacle. While the neutral countries understand
    their reason to do so. The decision is expected to have significant economic
    and political consequences, as it undermines the credibility of the country on
    the world stage and damages its relationships with other nations. \r"
