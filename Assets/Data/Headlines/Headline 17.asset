  HeadLineTextFormat: '{0} Bans All Vegetables, Results in Increased Meat Consumption
    and Smelly Emissions from its citizens. '
  ConsequenceTextFormat: The ban on all vegetables implemented by {0} caused a mixed
    reaction among other countries. While some appreciated the promotion of carnivorous
    diets and a reduction in methane emissions, others expressed concern about the
    potential for nutrient deficiencies and unpleasant bodily odors. Regardless of
    the controversy, the ban caused increased meat consumption and a surge in smelly
    emissions around the nation which resulted in the tourists from the nation to
    be smelly and ended up displeasing the town folk of other nations.
