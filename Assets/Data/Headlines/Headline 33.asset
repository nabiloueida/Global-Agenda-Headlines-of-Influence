  HeadLineTextFormat: "{0} Announces Closure of Major Bridges in Danger of Collapse
    Engineers Report Similar Structural Problems in Allied and Opposing Nations\r"
  ConsequenceTextFormat: "The continued investment by allies and enemies in war materials
    led them to neglect investment in infrastructure like roads, bridges and transportation.
    Eventually, many bridges were in danger of imminent collapse and had to be shut
    down. This crippled the domestic economies in these countries, because they could
    not move goods to manufacturing sites, and it was difficult to move finished
    products and food within the countries. The neutral states did not face these
    problems and were able to increase exports of goods and foodstuffs to the countries
    at war.\r"
