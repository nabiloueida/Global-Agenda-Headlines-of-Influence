  ConsequenceTextFormat: "{0} \"Space Tourism\" program was met with both excitement
    and concern from the international community. While it provided a new opportunity
    for space exploration and adventure, some countries viewed it as a threat to
    their own space programs and a potential invasion of their airspace. Moreover,
    the program raised concerns over privacy and safety, as more people entered space
    and were able to access and potentially manipulate sensitive data. \r"
