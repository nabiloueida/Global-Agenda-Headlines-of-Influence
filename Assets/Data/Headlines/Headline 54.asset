  ConsequenceTextFormat: With {0} now out of favor, they struggled to get invited
    to neutral countries' parties. Some allies attempted to bribe their way in with
    fancy gifts, while others resorted to bringing their own chips and dip, hoping
    to win over the hosts with their snack selection. This whole situation has caused
    the allied countries to look down on their allies as it seems petty and weak.
