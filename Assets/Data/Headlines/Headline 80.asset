  HeadLineTextFormat: '{0} Unite with enemies and call for a halt to all tensions
    between them to Tackle Climate Change. They have decided to join forces with
    their enemies rather than their allies as they are facing similar issues.

'
  ConsequenceTextFormat: "The enemy and neutral countries come together to combat
    the growing threat of climate change that's affecting their respective regions.
    Despite the allies' repeated calls to join forces, they are excluded from the
    discussions and must now develop their own plan of action. This lack of cooperation
    on a critical issue has the potential to strain relationships between the allies,
    enemies, and neutrals. The allied countries have chosen not to comment on this.\r"
